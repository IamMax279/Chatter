# Chatter - reddit clone #

## Description & motivation ##
Chatter is a project whose business logic and underlying systems are supposed to resemble those of reddit. I came up with this idea and started coding it up because
I feel like it's rather complex and will allow me to expand my architectural knowledge. Besides, it's a great project idea where I can utilize the cloud like AWS or GCP.

## Features ##
Right now, the project is in development phase, but some things I've already implemented include:
- DDD architectural pattern
- User business logic (User aggregate and Value Objects)
- Login & Register services
- Custom jwt filter and SecurityFilterChain implementation
- Psql database integration

## Tech-stack (so far) ##
Technologies used up until this point include:
- Java
- Spring Boot, Spring Security
- Docker
- PostgreSQL
